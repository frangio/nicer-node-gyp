# `nicer-node-gyp` ðŸŒ¾

**Improve your workflow by caching native dependencies.**

If you're tired of pages and pages of C++ warnings when you just want to develop a JavaScript project, look no further. `nicer-node-gyp` caches native dependencies for a **faster** workflow, and silences the compiler output for a **happier** experience.

You can also use this to improve your CI times.
